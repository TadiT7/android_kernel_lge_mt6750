config MTK_CLKMGR
	bool "Mediatek proprietary clock management"
	default n
	---help---
	  Mediatek proprietary clock management is used to operate
          the clocks. The clocks are composed of CG, MUX, PLL,
          non-MTCMOS. The operations of clocks are enabling,
          disabling, and querying status. If this config is not set,
          system will use COMMON_CLK instead.

config MTK_DISABLE_PICACHU
        bool "Disable Picachu"
        default n
        ---help---
          PICACHU (PI CAlibration and CHaracterization Utility) aims
          at the voltage calibration during booting. It increases
	  the voltage when needed.

config MTK_SODI_ON
	bool "Enable SODI"
	default n
	depends on (ARCH_MT6735 || ARCH_MT6735M || ARCH_MT6753)
	---help---
	   Enable Screen ON DeepIdle (SODI) if needed.

config MTK_HYBRID_CPU_DVFS
	bool "MediaTek Hybrid CPU DVFS support"
	default n
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to control CONFIG_HYBRID_CPU_DVFS
	  defined/undefined in the header file of CPUHVFS driver.
	  If CONFIG_HYBRID_CPU_DVFS is defined, CPUHVFS driver will bring up
	  DVFS processor to do CPU DVFS.

config MTK_SPM_USE_EXT_BUCK
	bool "MTK SPM use ext buck"
	default n
	help
	  Vmd1 is controlled by an ext buck. If you want to use ext buck for
	  Vmd1, set y here, or it dependeds on the efuse value.

config MT2701_DCM
	bool "Enable MT2701/MT7623 dynamic clock manager"
	default y
	depends on (MACH_MT2701 || ARCH_MT7623) && MTK_BASE_POWER
	---help---
	  Dynamic Clock Manager(DCM) can help slow bus frequency when
	  DCM's hardware detects bus is in idle state.

config MTK_CPU_HOTPLUG_DEBUG_0
	bool "MediaTek CPU Hotplug DEBUG 0"
	default y
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to enable log message in cpu notify
	  callback function in register_cpu_notifier. This is useful for CPU
	  hotplug debug.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config MTK_CPU_HOTPLUG_DEBUG_1
	bool "MediaTek CPU Hotplug DEBUG 1"
	default n
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to enable log message in cpu notify
	  callback function in notifier_call_chain. This is useful for CPU
	  hotplug debug but the performance will be drop down.
	  If unsure, say N.

config MTK_CPU_HOTPLUG_DEBUG_2
	bool "MediaTek CPU Hotplug DEBUG 2"
	default y
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to enable aee to log cpu notify
	  callback in notifier_call_chain. This is useful for CPU hotplug
	  debug.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config PROFILE_CPU
	bool "Support for CPU hot-plug profiling"
	default y
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to enable basic CPU hot-plug
	  latency for each one. This information is useful for someone who
	  care the latency, for example, thermal.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config MTK_CPU_HOTPLUG_DEBUG_3
	bool "MediaTek CPU Hotplug DEBUG 3"
	default y
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to enable advanced CPU hot-plug
	  latency profiling. This information is useful for someone who
	  care the latency, for example, thermal.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config POWER_AWARENESS_HPS
        bool "LGE Power-Awareness HPS support"
        default n
        help
          This kernel config can be used for power-awareness HPS.
          defined/undefined in the mt_hotplug_strategy_algo.c file.
          Power-awareness HPS reduces power consumption and improves
          general performance.
